Hello jasmine hello recast, here my Technical Test.

Once again sorry, for the time taken i have just started new mission at Data-Impact.
Was a bit difficult to find time. :-/

To run this project :
```shell
yarn install
yarn start
```

Obviously, the code is not as much perfect as i wish, ( it's never as perfect as wish ;-).
On the good point the code it's pretty clean, readable and straightforward. :thumbsup: :thumbsup: :thumbsup:

Maybe, it would have been good to use immutable, thought it would be overkill but did have to deal with object mutation,
which make the code less readable. :thumbsdown:

Learned React with redux and immutable, now i know what it is to deal with mutation i do not want that anymore. :pensive:
And git commit are very very dirty :scream:

:star: Special feature : Double click on the card to edit it.

Happy code review
Edouard
