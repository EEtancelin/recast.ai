Hello Jasmine,  hello Recast, here my technical test.

Once again sorry, for the time taken i have just started a new mission at Data-Impact.
Was a bit difficult to find time. :pensive:

To run this project :
```shell
yarn install
yarn start
```

Obviously, the code is not as much perfect as i wish, ( it's never as perfect as wish) :wink:.
On the good point the code it's pretty clean, readable and straingforward. :thumbsup:

Maybe, it would have been good to use immutable, thought it would be overkill but did have to deal with object mutation,
which make the code less readable. :thumbsdown:

Learned React with redux and immutable, now i know what it is to deal with mutation i do not want that anymore. :pensive:
And git commit are very very dirty :scream:

:star: Special feature : Double click on the card to edit it.

Wish you a good night :sleeping: :sleeping:  :zzz: , it's nearly :clock2: AM now.

Happy code review
Edouard
