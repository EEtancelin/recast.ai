Hi Here my Technical Test.

Once again sorry, for the time taken i have just started new mission at Data-Impact.
Was a bit difficult to find time. :-/

To run this project please run these commands
yarn install
yarn start

Obviously, the code is not as much perfect as i wish, ( it's never as perfect as wish ;-).
On the good point the code it's pretty clean, readable and straingforward.

Maybe, it would have been good to use immutable, thought it would be overkill but did have to deal with object mutation.
which make the code less readable.
Learned React with redux and immutable, now i know what it is to deal with mutation i do not want that anymore. :-)
And git commit are very very dirty :-/

Special feature : Double click on the card to edit it.

Happy code review
Edouard
